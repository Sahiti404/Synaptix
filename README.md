Detecting anomalies in time series data is a challenging task, especially when labeled datasets are unavailable. Traditional methods often analyze individual data points or simple pairwise relationships, but they fail to capture the complex dependencies within time series data. The Anomaly Transformer addresses this challenge by leveraging its self-attention mechanism, enabling it to analyze the entire sequence of data. This approach allows the model to uncover intricate dependencies and patterns that traditional methods often miss, making it highly effective in detecting anomalies, even in the absence of labeled data.
